# Evaluation for OpenCV Haar frontal face
Evaluation script for Haar frontal face

## Requirements
OpenCV 3
Python 2.7
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
jupyter notebook

## Purpose
Evaluate the detector using some open database.

## Scripts
Python scripts are modidied from orginal sample script from OpenCV to use class.

### HaarFrontal.py
a class version to use OpenCV Haar cascade frontal face detector.

Evaluation scripts are written as jupyter notebook file (*.ipynb)

```
$ jupyter notebook
```


### evaluate detection ratio

- haarCascade_cnn.ipynb
- haarCascade_headPose.ipynb
- haarCascade_lfw.ipynb


### evaluate detection ratio with roll

- haarCascade_headPose_rotate.ipynb
- haarCascade_lfw_rotate.ipynb


### evaluate detection ratio with size

- haarCascade_headPose_size.ipynb
- haarCascade_lfw_size.ipynb


### Results

You can see some results in the jupyter notebook file.


Some comments are written in Japanese.
