# Tensorflow Face Detector
A mobilenet SSD(single shot multibox detector) based face detector with pretrained model provided, powered by tensorflow [object detection api](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), trained by [WIDERFACE dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/).

## Features
Speed, run 60fps on a nvidia GTX1080 GPU.

Memory, requires less than 364Mb GPU memory for single inference.

Robust, adapt to different poses, this feature is credit to [WIDERFACE dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/), I manually cleaned the dataset to balance the precision and recall trade off.

Parallel, multiple process video processing, can inference multiple input simultaneously, I tested to process 4 videos on a single GPU card at the same time, the speed is still competitive, and there's still room to accommodate more processes.

## Dependencies
Tensorflow > 1.2

Tensorflow object detection api (Please follow the official installation instruction, otherwise, I cannot guarantee that you can run the code)

OpenCV python

## Usage
### Effect
Click [Youtube](https://youtu.be/gw4CVz7SPEs) to view the effect or [Youku](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzE2MDc0NzcyNA==.html?spm=a2h3j.8428770.3416059.1).

### Prepare pre-trained model
Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5ttP5kO_loUdWZWZVVrN2VmWFk) to download the pre-trained model from google drive.
Put the model under the model folder.

### Prepare video
Put your test video (mp4 format) under the media folder, rename it as test.mp4.

### Run video detection
At the source root
```bash
python inference_video_face.py
```
After finished the processing, find the output video at media folder.


### Run detection from usb camera

You can see how this face detection works with your web camera.
```
usage:inference_usbCam_face.py (cameraID | filename)
```

Here is an example to use usb camera with cameraID=0.

```bash
python inference_usbCam_face.py 0
```

Note: this script does not save video.



### Known Issue

Please view that issue [here](https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection/issues/5) if your output video is blank. A brief reminder is: check the input codec and check the input/output resolution, since this part is irrelevant to the algorithm, no modification will be made to master branch.

# Evaluation for detection

Evaluation script for tensorflow face detection

## Requirements
OpenCV 3
Python 2.7
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
jupyter notebook

## Purpose
Evaluate tensorflow face detection using some open database.

## Scripts
Python scripts are modidied from orginal tensorflow face detection to use class.

### inference_file_face.py
a class version to use tensorflow face detection

Evaluation scripts are written as jupyter notebook file (*.ipynb)

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

### evalate detection ratio
- log_lfw.ipynb
- log_headPose.ipynb
- log_cnn.ipynb


### evalate detection ratio with roll

- log_headPose_rotate.ipynb
- log_lfw_rotate.ipynb

### Results

You can see some results in the jupyter notebook file.
Some plots show that resnet_ssd_face_python in OpenCV has high detection ratio.
